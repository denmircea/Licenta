PROJECT SUMMARY
This project focuses on the development of a mobile delivery application built with React Native, offering separate interfaces for all types of users (customers, delivery users and administrations). A key feature of the app is a personalized recommendation system, based on a custom algorithm I created. Its purpose is to suggest relevant options to users in a smart and adaptive way, depending on their preferences and behavior within the app.
The idea for this project came from my passion for programming, algorithms, and learning new technologies, as well as my growing interest in how digital tools support the business world. I wanted to build something practical and up-to-date, using technologies that are widely adopted in the industry today.
Throughout the process, I dealt with several challenges, such as ensuring smooth cross-platform performance, managing data efficiently, and integrating the recommendation system without compromising user experience. These were addressed through a mix of research, trial and error, and gradual improvements.
My personal contribution includes the design and implementation of the recommendation algorithm, building users interfaces, and choosing the right tools and libraries to make the app scalable and efficient. Besides the technical experience, this project taught me a lot about mobile development, structuring real-world apps, and the balance between functionality and usability.
